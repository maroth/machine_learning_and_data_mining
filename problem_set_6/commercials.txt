Divide into 5 individual training and testing sets.

set 1:

 a b   <-- classified as
 1 0 | a = Male
 1 0 | b = Female


set 2:

 a b   <-- classified as
 1 1 | a = Male
 0 0 | b = Female


set 3:

 a b   <-- classified as
 0 0 | a = Male
 1 1 | b = Female


set 4:

 a b   <-- classified as
 1 1 | a = Male
 0 0 | b = Female


set 5:

 a b   <-- classified as
 1 0 | a = Male
 0 1 | b = Female
 
sum of confusion matrix:

 a b   <-- classified as
 4 2 | a = Male
 2 2 | b = Female


5-Fold Cross Validation using WEKA:

 a b   <-- classified as
 4 2 | a = Male
 2 2 | b = Female

The sum of my individual matrixes matches the confusion matrix output by WEKA. Success!

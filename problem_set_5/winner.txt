Fix a significance level:

The problem states that we need to show that there is less than a 5% chance that there is no difference in true speed between the different racers. So we choose a significance level of 5.

Divide the significance level by two:

-> Significance Level = 2.5%

We have ten samples, so we have 9 degrees of freedom. This fives us:

-> Confidence Limit: 2.262

Then we use the formula for the t-statistic:

t_obs (Han-Luke):  -2.5610632643
t_obs (Luke-Nien): -0.6225374401
t_obs (Nien-Han):   1.9159256838

For the calculations of the confidence levesl, see the attached spreadsheet.

The confidence levels for Luke-Nien und Nien-Han are smaller than the confidence limit. This means the difference is significant, and the null hypothesis (that these runners are of equal speed) can be rejected.

However, the confidence level for Han and Luke is larger than the confidence limit. This means that the two racers might be of equal skill: They should race again.
